Hello! My name is Pablo Escobedo and this is a repository holding a good amount of my school projects, assignments, and side projects. To any future employer that may stumble here, please note that this is not my entire collection of projects as I have a good amount of them stuck on a broken laptop I have not been able to fix yet. Please do excuse the inconvenience.
